### About the Model 
In this very simple model of social distancing,
 a fixed portion of the population is willing 
or able to follow distancing, and for those 
who are, all contacts are reduced by a 
fraction f. This simple model agrees 
well with more complex models that 
consider different kinds of contacts 
(home, work, school, community) 
with opposing effects under 
different kinds of social 
distancing measures. For example, 
with schools closed, household contact 
rates may have a slight rise; some community 
contacts remain even if people work remotely.
 This model assumes homogeneous mixing in the 
population, which despite the complexity of 
human communities, has been shown to do a 
surprisingly good job of reflecting the 
dynamics of respiratory viruses. 

### Creating Scenarios 

Below three different scenarios of the model can be created and modified. Initially they are set with: 
* Scenario A: no social distancing measures taken 
* Scenario B: medium-scale social distancing
* Scenario C: large-scale social distancing
