# SimpleSocialDistancing
A simple model for COVID19 with social distancing 

This repo has a very simple model of social distancing. It appears to agree with much more complex models and is potentially a useful tool 
for visualising the time scale and peak size based on what we know to date (~mid-March 2020) about COVID19.

A shiny app for investigating different social distancing scenarios using the model is at: https://magpiegroup.shinyapps.io/distancingModel/
